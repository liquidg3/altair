# Lifecycle Object managing a simple State Machine
A StateMachine is an object that has a this.state, can be one of any this.states = ['state1', 'state2'],
and can transition between states;

In altair/StateMachine, when the states transition (state1 -> state2), we'll fire some events, executing callbacks you have configured . By
using the Altair/Lifecycle (modules, commanders, etc) to manage your State Machine, you get a great way to configure state
machines at run time. This flexibility allows you to do some pretty cool things (like optimization). Note that altair/StateMachines
are not linear, we can transition to any state in any order at any time, so your callbacks must take it into consideration.

In this example, I'm going to show you how I built commandcentral/commanders/Altair, which is the object you have interfaced
with if you have ever used Altair. By using a State Machine to independently manage the state of a user's CLI session,
we can keep our code super thin and clean.

This is an abbreviated example, see the [the actual code](https://github.com/liquidg3/altair/blob/master/core/vendors/altair/modules/commandcentral/commanders/Altair.js)
for the a fully working example.
